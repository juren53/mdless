## Development

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70 or later
- Cargo

### Building

```bash
cargo build --release
```

### Running tests

```bash
cargo test
```

### Code formatting and linting

```bash
cargo fmt
cargo clippy
```

### Pre-commit hooks

The project includes a pre-commit hook that automatically runs formatting checks, linting, compilation verification, and tests before each commit. To install the hook:

```bash
# Install or reinstall the pre-commit hook
./scripts/install-hooks.sh
```

The pre-commit hook will run:

- `cargo check` - Fast compilation check (runs first)
- `cargo fmt --check` - Verify code formatting
- `cargo clippy` - Run linter with warnings as errors
- `cargo test` - Run all tests

To run the checks manually without committing:

```bash
./scripts/pre-commit-checks.sh
```

To bypass the hook for a specific commit (not recommended):

```bash
git commit --no-verify
```
